        I am Jhon Barry D. Gutang, An Information Technology Graduate that
        aspires to become a Software Engineer. Not really your hardcore programmer
        as i tend to enjoy learning while having fun with the things i do. I love 
        diving to new technologies and exploring them by building projects either out 
        of fun or for practical use. Outside programming, i enjoy gaming like a lot. 
        I play retro games like pokemon, zelda and sonic. Sometimes i play DOTA 2 with friends.
        I also love watching anime and reading manga. Sometime i watch kdrama and manhwa. And also
        watching western movies and series. I'm really a big fan of series and movies that's 
        why i watch a lot. Especially the works of Christopher Nolan, MCU, and some old classics
        like Shawshank Redemption, Good Will Hunting, Dead Poets Society and etc.

        Right now, i'm focusing more on my career and my growth to achieve what i aspire to be.
        i am working right now as an Apprentice Software Developer for Maplab. Making meaningful 
        projects that aims to ease the lives of its users through ai integrations. Working with Maplab
        creates a lot of opportunites for me to learn different technologies, concepts, and especially 
        how to utilize ai as an assistant. I created this website to store what i have learned, 
        because documenting learnings help me understand them better and remember them longer.
        I hope you find this website useful as well.
